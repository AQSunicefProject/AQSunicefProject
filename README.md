Our project focuses on combating malnutrition through a multi-faceted approach encompassing various critical components. Firstly, we prioritize Targeted Resource Allocation, identifying regions and communities with high malnutrition levels to direct interventions and resources where they are most needed efficiently. Early Intervention is a key aspect, achieved through data analysis to detect and predict malnutrition promptly, enabling timely and preventive measures for at-risk children. Personalized Nutritional Support is another vital element, as our model analyzes individual health data and dietary habits to create personalized nutrition plans for those in need. Nutritional Quality Improvement is addressed by assessing the nutritional content of food products and meals, guiding the development of balanced and nutritious diets for malnourished individuals. Lastly, our proposed model fosters Collaborative Solutions, encouraging cooperation among researchers, policymakers, and organizations to share data, insights, and best practices for more effective solutions against malnutrition
